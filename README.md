## 7.  Credits
I tried out the MLOps lab part of the MCW (credit to Solliance) set of hands on labs, then attended Azure DevOps OpenHack, went back and looked at the Azure docs, and product teams samples (credit to Pranith), and decided to take my learnings and code base from these and add my own embellishments to it.  My special thanks to Dr. Thomas Abraham for his guidance, constructive criticism, testing, and for authoring the last module to get us up to speed on the latest and greatest possibilities with AML and MLOps.
