## 7.  Credits
I tried out the MLOps lab, that is part of the MCW (credit to Solliance) set of hands on labs, then attended Azure DevOps OpenHack, went back and read the Azure docs, and product teams' samples (credit to Pranith, Jordan), and decided to take my learnings and code base from these and build on it.  Credit to data scientist, Michael Kareev for the experiment he shared with me.  My special thanks to Dr. Thomas Abraham for his guidance, constructive criticism, testing, and for authoring the last module to get us up to speed on the latest and greatest possibilities with AML and MLOps. 

One thing I strived to do is correlate DevOps to assets getting created/provisioned/deployed in the Azure Machine Leearning workspace for better understanding.  Hope you found this helpful.
