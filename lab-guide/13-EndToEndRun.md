# Module 13 - Execute and end to end run

## About
This module covers cleaning up your workspace, editing the code, and committing to master -> this triggers an end to end, build to release pipeline.  This will help us ensure everything works as expected from a continuous deployment perspective.  Lets do this lab twice and observe how the release pipeline differs the second time around in the logs.
